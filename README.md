# Penguin Paddle!

Hi everybody, this is the project I've been working on recently for Hackclub's Undercity. 

Penguin Paddle is my own iambic morse code keyer that has multiple differrent output options, including a buzzer to make sound. It is designed with future expansion in mind with mounting holes and solder joints for potentially adding vertical pads in the future, and a usb-c port for keyboard support.
